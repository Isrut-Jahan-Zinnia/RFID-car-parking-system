# Real-time-RFID-car-parking-system
CourseProject: Embedded Systems. It's a Digital Car Parking System by using RFID. 

## Description:
The purpose of the project is to reduce the number of workers in the garage and reduce the prevalence of
owners of cars because there is in the 7-meter counter at the entry of the car has a count down. While,
when the exit is counting ascending or according to what is mentioned or written within the programming
of Arduino and determine the absorption of the garage number of vehicles through the owner. When the
highest value of the meter, the door of the garage is closed electronically and can’t be opened until the
exit one of the cars.
